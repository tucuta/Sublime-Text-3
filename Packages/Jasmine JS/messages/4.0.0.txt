==============

New command! Toggle quotes

This command will change the snippets from the current active quotes to it's counterpart.

For example, it will transform this:

describe("Name of the group", function() {
    
});

to this

describe('Name of the group', function() {
    
});


IMPORTANT:

1. After each toggle you may need to restart Sublime to the changes to take effect (sorry for that).

2. If you're seeing the snippets twice, is because Package Control didn't update the package to the last version correctly. If it doesn't get fix automatically, please reinstall the package.

That's all, thanks!
